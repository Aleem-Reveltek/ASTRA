Accreditation in the United States is a complex process that involves multiple steps and can vary depending on the accrediting body and the specific requirements of the programs and institutions involved. Here are some key points to consider based on the standard accreditation processes recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA):

Institutional vs. Programmatic Accreditation
Institutional Accreditation:

This type of accreditation evaluates the entire institution, including its mission, governance, administration, financial stability, admissions, student services, and overall educational quality.
If your university seeks institutional accreditation, the accrediting body will assess the university as a whole. Once accredited, the institution can offer various programs under the accredited status.
Institutional accreditation is typically granted by regional accrediting agencies or national accrediting agencies.
Programmatic (or Specialized) Accreditation:

This type of accreditation focuses on specific programs within an institution, such as business, engineering, law, or health sciences.
Programmatic accreditation ensures that a particular program meets the standards of the profession or field it represents.
For example, a Master of Business Administration (MBA) program might seek accreditation from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), while a Master of Public Health (MPH) program might seek accreditation from the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH).
Customizable Programs and Accreditation
If your university plans to offer customizable master's programs where students can pick and choose courses across different disciplines, you will need to consider both institutional and programmatic accreditation.
Institutional Accreditation: Ensure that the university as a whole meets the standards of a recognized accrediting body. This will provide a foundational level of quality assurance for all programs offered by the institution.
Programmatic Accreditation: Depending on the nature of the customizable programs, you may need to seek programmatic accreditation for specific disciplines if they are critical to the professional recognition of the degrees. For example, if you offer a customizable Master of Science in Engineering, you might need to ensure that the engineering components meet the standards of an accrediting body like ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology).
Steps to Achieve Accreditation
Self-Study: Conduct a comprehensive self-study to evaluate the institution's compliance with the accrediting body's standards.
Application: Submit an application for accreditation to the chosen accrediting body.
Site Visit: Prepare for a site visit by the accrediting body’s evaluation team, which will assess the institution’s facilities, resources, faculty, and programs.
Review and Decision: The accrediting body will review the findings from the site visit and the self-study report to make an accreditation decision.
Continuous Improvement: Maintain and improve standards to comply with accreditation requirements, including periodic reviews and re-accreditation processes.
Conclusion
In summary, while institutional accreditation will cover the university as a whole and allow for the offering of various programs, specific professional programs may still require programmatic accreditation to ensure they meet industry standards. This dual approach ensures that the institution provides a high-quality education and that specific programs meet the professional and academic standards necessary for graduates to be recognized in their fields.

For a university located in West Virginia seeking regional accreditation, you will be working with the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), which is the regional accrediting body responsible for accrediting institutions of higher education in West Virginia and other states in the North Central region of the United States.

Steps to Achieve HLC Accreditation
Eligibility Process:

Pre-Application: Review the HLC’s eligibility requirements to ensure your institution meets the basic criteria for accreditation.
Eligibility Filing: Submit an Eligibility Filing, which includes detailed information about your institution’s mission, governance, resources, and educational programs.
Candidacy Status:

Candidacy Application: If the Eligibility Filing is accepted, your institution will be invited to apply for candidacy status. This involves a more detailed self-study and a comprehensive review by HLC.
Candidacy Visit: HLC will conduct a site visit to evaluate your institution’s readiness for candidacy status. This includes interviews with faculty, staff, and students, and a review of facilities and resources.
Candidacy Decision: Based on the site visit and the self-study report, HLC will decide whether to grant candidacy status. Candidacy is a pre-accreditation status that indicates the institution is progressing toward meeting HLC standards.
Initial Accreditation:

Self-Study Report: Conduct a comprehensive self-study that addresses HLC’s Criteria for Accreditation, which include:
Mission
Integrity: Ethical and Responsible Conduct
Teaching and Learning: Quality, Resources, and Support
Teaching and Learning: Evaluation and Improvement
Institutional Effectiveness, Resources, and Planning
Evaluation Visit: HLC will conduct an evaluation visit to assess the institution’s compliance with the Criteria for Accreditation. This visit involves a thorough review of the self-study report, interviews, and an examination of institutional resources and processes.
Accreditation Decision: HLC’s Institutional Actions Council will review the evaluation team’s report and make a decision regarding initial accreditation.
Continuous Improvement and Reaffirmation:

Monitoring and Reporting: Accredited institutions must regularly submit reports and undergo periodic reviews to ensure ongoing compliance with HLC standards.
Reaffirmation of Accreditation: Institutions undergo a comprehensive evaluation every 10 years to reaffirm their accreditation status.
Considerations for Online Programs
While your current focus is on physical regional accreditation, it’s important to consider future plans for an online division. HLC has specific guidelines and expectations for online education, including:

Quality of Online Education: Ensure that online programs meet the same standards of quality and rigor as on-campus programs.
Student Support Services: Provide adequate support services for online students, including advising, library resources, and technical support.
Faculty Training and Support: Ensure that faculty teaching online courses are adequately trained and supported in online pedagogy and technology.
Conclusion
To achieve regional accreditation with the Higher Learning Commission, your university will need to undergo a rigorous process that includes eligibility determination, candidacy status, self-study, evaluation visits, and continuous improvement. By meeting HLC’s Criteria for Accreditation and maintaining high standards of educational quality and institutional effectiveness, your university can achieve and maintain accredited status, providing assurance of quality to students, employers, and other stakeholders.

OK, so specifically for HLC does A credit the entire institution? Or does it accredit degree? by degree? this answer will determine our approach to how many degrees we offer, because we are restrained by our budget and our time.

The Higher Learning Commission (HLC) accredits the entire institution, not individual degree programs. This means that once your university achieves HLC accreditation, all the degree programs offered by the institution are covered under this accreditation. However, there are important considerations to keep in mind:

Institutional Accreditation
Comprehensive Evaluation: HLC’s accreditation process involves a comprehensive evaluation of the entire institution, including its mission, governance, administration, financial stability, student services, and overall educational quality.
Criteria for Accreditation: The institution must meet HLC’s Criteria for Accreditation, which encompass all aspects of the institution’s operations and educational offerings.
Programmatic Considerations
Program Quality: While HLC accredits the institution as a whole, it expects that all programs offered by the institution meet high standards of quality. This includes having qualified faculty, adequate resources, and effective assessment and improvement processes.
New Programs: If your institution plans to introduce new degree programs after achieving accreditation, you may need to notify HLC and, in some cases, seek approval for significant changes or additions to your academic offerings. HLC has policies and procedures for substantive change that institutions must follow.
Strategic Approach
Given your budget and time constraints, here are some strategic considerations:

Focus on Core Programs: Initially, focus on a smaller number of core degree programs that align with your institution’s mission and strengths. This will allow you to allocate resources effectively and ensure high-quality offerings.
Build a Strong Foundation: Establish strong institutional processes, governance, and support services that will support the quality and growth of your academic programs.
Plan for Growth: Once you achieve initial accreditation, you can gradually expand your degree offerings. Ensure that each new program is well-planned and supported to maintain the overall quality of education.
Conclusion
HLC accredits the entire institution, which means that all degree programs offered by your university will be covered under this accreditation. This allows you to focus on building a strong institutional foundation and offering a manageable number of high-quality degree programs initially. As your institution grows and resources allow, you can expand your academic offerings while maintaining compliance with HLC’s standards and requirements.

So just to clarify once more, there is no additional fee if. on our initial degree accreditation, we have six different master's degrees there. ? would the fee for opening be different if we only offered bachelors only offered masters, or only offered ph D's?

---
The Higher Learning Commission (HLC) accredits the institution as a whole, rather than charging separate fees based on the number or types of degrees offered. Here are some key points to clarify your concerns:

Initial Accreditation Fees
Institutional Fee Structure:

HLC charges fees for the accreditation process based on the institution's overall status and activities, not the number or types of degrees offered.
Fees typically cover the costs of application, candidacy, site visits, and evaluation processes.
Application and Candidacy Fees:

These fees are associated with the initial application for accreditation and the candidacy process, including site visits and evaluations.
The fees are generally the same regardless of whether the institution offers bachelor's, master's, or doctoral programs.
Program Offerings
No Additional Fees for Multiple Degrees:

There are no additional fees specifically for offering multiple degrees (e.g., six different master's degrees) during the initial accreditation process. The focus is on the institution's overall ability to meet HLC’s Criteria for Accreditation.
Substantive Change Fees:

If the institution plans to add new programs or make significant changes after initial accreditation, there may be fees associated with the substantive change process. This is a separate process that ensures new programs meet HLC standards.
Strategic Considerations
Resource Allocation:

While there are no additional fees for offering multiple degrees, it is important to ensure that the institution has adequate resources (faculty, facilities, support services) to maintain the quality of all programs.
Focusing on a manageable number of high-quality programs initially can help ensure a successful accreditation process.
Future Program Expansion:

Once accredited, the institution can expand its program offerings. Any significant changes or additions may require notification to HLC and, in some cases, approval through the substantive change process.
Conclusion
In summary, HLC charges fees for the accreditation process based on the institution as a whole, not on the number or types of degrees offered. There are no additional fees specifically for offering multiple master's degrees during the initial accreditation process. However, ensure that your institution has the necessary resources to support all programs effectively. Future program expansions may involve additional processes and fees through the substantive change process.
