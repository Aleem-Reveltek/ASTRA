### ðŸ“¢ The information outlined below needs updated to match the "Filled-Up Table by SQ"

Now let's do curriculum creation that is acceptable by US standards and from an HLC perspective and also make it futuristic. However, make sure the curriculum enable learners to hop to another college/university/school if they want to transfer. 

Our focus are Advancement, Science, Technology, reasoning, automation, linguistics. We are just incorporating the chakras, unalome, and the 7 steps to perfection. So don't start your answer on the chakra system or the unalome or the 7 steps.

From this matrix let's start with first row where you will design a curriculum for Advancement, Science, Technology, reasoning, automation, linguistics:

| **Chakras**      | **Unalome**           | **7 Steps to Perfection** | **Advancement** | **Science** | **Technology** | **Reasoning** | **Automation** | **Linguistics** |
|------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|------------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| Crown             | Leader Hive           | Perspective               |                  |           |                |                |                |                  |

The title is not Curriculum Design for the Crown Chakra. It's just curriculum design period. However the contents of your curriculum design for this row is in the crown chakra so you can still include how the crown chakra is associated on each area of the ASTRAL. Write in table format following below, also write notes in narrative form below the table that has the Course Title, Description, and Learning Outcomes
